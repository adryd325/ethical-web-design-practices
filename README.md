# ethical-and-user-friendly-web-design-practices
A list of practices that are irritating to the end-user and less irritating alternatives. 

## Goals of this project
My primary goal for this project is to find a middle ground between the wants of website owners, advertizers and end users. At the moment the list is very rough, but I plan to keep adding things that irritate me and others.  

### Cookies messages
Place a cookies message at the very top of the page.  
Do not obstruct content.  
Do not attepmpt to decieve the user into accepting cookies, describe exactly what they are and what they do.  
Link to your privacy policy on the cookies banner.  

### Tracking
Allow the user to decide if tracking is enabled, perhaps in the same banner as a cookies message.  
**Obey doNotTrack**  
  Sidenote: Many browsers have doNotTrack enabled by default. If you still wish to collect data, ask the user for consent first.  
Ask users for concent to tracking systems that provide information to third parties.  
Do not use social media share buttons, design your own or have them load only after the user presses share.  

### Advertizements\n
Do not use advertizements that pretend to be recomended articles.  
Do not use advertizements that pretend to be a download button.  
Do not use advertizements that mimmic site content.  
Do not use popup or popunder advertizements.  
Do not prevent users with adblock from using yourside, instead, provide an alternative such as a donation link or simply recomending the user to whitelist your site. Do not use full screen popups for this, replace the area where an advertizement.   would be for the message. Promise that your website does not use obtrusive advertizements  

// todo: newsletters, popups as user leaves the page, forced logins (*cough quora cough*), manipulative ways of advertizement (*cough bandcamp cough*)
