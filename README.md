# ethical-and-user-friendly-web-design-practices
A list of practices that are irritating to the end-user and less irritating alternatives. 

## Goals of this project
My primary goal for this project is to find a middle ground between the wants of website owners, advertisers and end users. At the moment the list is very rough, but I plan to keep adding things that irritate me and others. Many things on this list might be opinionated. If you disagree with something said, please make an issue and explain why you disagree.

Contributions to the list via PRs and issues are encouraged!

**Obey doNotTrack**  
  Sidenote: Many browsers have doNotTrack enabled by default. If you still wish to collect data, ask the user for consent first.  
Ask users for concent to tracking systems that provide information to third parties.  
Do not use social media share buttons, design your own or have them load only after the user presses share.  

### Advertisements
Do not use advertisements that pretend to be recomended articles.  
Do not use advertisements that pretend to be a download button.  
Do not use advertisements that mimmic site content.  
Do not use popup or popunder advertisements.  
Do not prevent users with ad-blockers from using your webside, instead, provide an alternative such as a donation link or simply recomending the user to whitelist your site. Do not use full screen popups for this. you can add a message that promises your website does not use obtrusive advertisements.   

// todo: newsletters, popups as user leaves the page, forced logins (*cough quora cough*), manipulative ways of advertisement (*cough bandcamp cough*)
